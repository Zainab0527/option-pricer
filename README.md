# option-pricer

A comprehensive Python toolkit for pricing European options and analyzing their sensitivities using the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulation.

Overview

This project provides production-ready implementations of:

- Black-Scholes pricing for European call and put options
- Monte Carlo simulation for option valuation and model validation
- Greeks calculation (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) for risk management
- Implied volatility solver to extract market expectations from option prices
- Sensitivity analysis with interactive heatmaps


Features:

-  Fast analytical pricing using Black-Scholes formulas
-  Monte Carlo validation with 100k+ simulations
-  Five key Greeks for portfolio risk assessment
-  implied volatility extraction from market prices
-  2D sensitivity heatmaps (underlying price vs. volatility)
-  Sub-100ms execution time for all calculations
